## Notes

I faced some challenges while trying to get familiar with Android Studio, and also work on the app. Using additional classes to import for the use of reading and writing lines onto data files, and using deprecated functions were two of the hardest issues to solve, but I ended up finally pushing through and building a perfectly functional application.
